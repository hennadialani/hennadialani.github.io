## Hi there! Welcome to my website!
My name is Henna and I'm a Statistics senior at the University of California, Los Angeles minoring in Digital Humanities and Mathematics. I was born and raised in Hong Kong by Indian immigrant parents, attending a British school prior to college in the United States. I have previous experience in using data visualization and building machine learning models to solve problems. My favorite universe is the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). 

This past summer I interned at Goldman Sachs in the Securities Division as a Strats intern, where I built out dashboards for FX traders and classification models for an electronic trading platform. I also worked with the Global Investment Research Technology team to design A/B tests for a new feature. Before that, I worked at the Big Data to Knowledge Center as a data science research intern in Los Angeles, and a data science intern at AIA Group Limited in Hong Kong. 

When I'm not hitting the books at school, I run the data journalism blog of my school's newspaper, [The Stack](http://stack.dailybruin.com). We uncover stories about the UCLA community and Westwood by digging into databases, APIs, scanned handwritten documents, etc. Sometimes we just play with new ways to represent data. I'm also found in hackathons hauling a new wardrobe home after two days of Soylent-fuelled productivity. I have also been actively involved in research and other student organizations relating to diversity, artivism, and mental health during my time at UCLA.

I'm grateful to everyone who's helped me grow in many ways during my time at college - family, friends, professors, and many more. I can't wait to see where my last year of undergrad takes me. I'm a [Grace Hopper 2018 Scholar](https://ghc.anitab.org/2018-student-academic/scholarships/our-ghc-18-scholars-1/) and a [Rewriting the Code Fellow](https://rewritingthecode.org/). I'm also a [True Bruin Distinguished Senior Award Finalist](https://alumni.ucla.edu/scholarships/prospective-students/true-bruin-distinguished-senior-award/) and an Undergraduate Research Fellow. 

At this point, you've read a decent amount about me and want to probably connect with me. [Email me](mailto:hennadialani@ucla.edu) to talk about food, stats, math, and/or art! You can also check out my [Github](https://github.com/hennadialani) or resumé.
