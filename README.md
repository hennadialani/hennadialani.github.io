## Welcome to my website!
My name is Henna and I'm a Statistics senior at the University of California, Los Angeles minoring in Digital Humanities and Mathematics. I was born and raised in Hong Kong by incredible Indian immigrant parents, attending a British school prior to college in the United States. I have had previous experience in using data visualization and building machine learning models to solve data-driven problems. My favorite universe is the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). Hit me up at hennadialani at ucla dot edu to talk about food, stats, math, and/or art! You can also check out my github or resume. 

This past summer I interned at Goldman Sachs in the Securities Division as a Strats intern, where I got to build out dashboards for FX traders and classification models for an electronic trading platform. I also worked briefly with the Global Investment Research Technology team to design A/B tests via the Adobe Analytics API.

When I'm not hitting the books, I run the data journalism section of my school's newspaper, [The Stack](http://stack.dailybruin.com). We uncover stories about the UCLA community and Westwood by digging into databases, APIs, scanned handwritten documents, etc. Sometimes we just play with new ways to represent data. I'm also found in hackathons hauling a new wardrobe home after two days of Soylent-fuelled productivity. I have also been actively involved in research and other student organizations relating to diversity, artivism, mental health during my time at UCLA.

I'm grateful to everyone who's helped me grow in many ways during my time at college - family, friends, professors, and many more. I'm a [Grace Hopper 2018 Scholar](https://ghc.anitab.org/2018-student-academic/scholarships/our-ghc-18-scholars-1/) and a [Rewriting the Code Fellow](https://rewritingthecode.org/). I'm also a [True Bruin Distinguished Senior Award Finalist](https://alumni.ucla.edu/scholarships/prospective-students/true-bruin-distinguished-senior-award/) and an Undergraduate Research Fellow.
